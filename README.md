## Features

- **Two-tier highlighting system**:
  - Light backgrounds for entire modified lines (green for insertions, red for deletions)
  - Deep/dark character-level highlights showing exact changes within lines
- **Side-by-side diff view** in a new tab with synchronized scrolling
- **Git integration**: Compare between any git revision (HEAD, commits, branches, tags)
- **Same implementation as VSCode's diff engine**, providing identical visual highlighting for most scenarios
- **Fast C-based diff computation** using FFI with **multi-core parallelization** (OpenMP)
- **Async git operations** - non-blocking file retrieval from git

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim >= 0.7.0 (for Lua FFI support; 0.10+ recommended for vim.system)
- Git (for git diff features)
- `curl` or `wget` (for automatic binary download)
- `nui.nvim` (for explorer UI)

**No compiler required!** The plugin automatically downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub releases.

### Using lazy.nvim

**Minimal installation:**
```lua
{
  "esmuellert/vscode-diff.nvim",
  dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
}
```

> **Note:** The plugin automatically adapts to your colorscheme's background (dark/light). It uses `DiffAdd` and `DiffDelete` for line-level diffs, and auto-adjusts brightness for character-level highlights (1.4x brighter for dark themes, 0.92x darker for light themes). See [Highlight Groups](#highlight-groups) for customization.

**With custom configuration:**
```lua
{
  "esmuellert/vscode-diff.nvim",
  dependencies = { "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim" },
  config = function()
    require("vscode-diff").setup({
      -- Highlight configuration
      highlights = {
        -- Line-level: accepts highlight group names or hex colors (e.g., "#2ea043")
        line_insert = "DiffAdd",      -- Line-level insertions
        line_delete = "DiffDelete",   -- Line-level deletions
        
        -- Character-level: accepts highlight group names or hex colors
        -- If specified, these override char_brightness calculation
        char_insert = nil,            -- Character-level insertions (nil = auto-derive)
        char_delete = nil,            -- Character-level deletions (nil = auto-derive)
        
        -- Brightness multiplier (only used when char_insert/char_delete are nil)
        -- nil = auto-detect based on background (1.4 for dark, 0.92 for light)
        char_brightness = nil,        -- Auto-adjust based on your colorscheme
      },
      
      -- Diff view behavior
      diff = {
        disable_inlay_hints = true,         -- Disable inlay hints in diff windows for cleaner view
        max_computation_time_ms = 5000,     -- Maximum time for diff computation (VSCode default)
      },
      
      -- Keymaps in diff view
      keymaps = {
        view = {
          next_hunk = "]c",   -- Jump to next change
          prev_hunk = "[c",   -- Jump to previous change
          next_file = "]f",   -- Next file in explorer mode
          prev_file = "[f",   -- Previous file in explorer mode
        },
        explorer = {
          select = "<CR>",    -- Open diff for selected file
          hover = "K",        -- Show file diff preview
          refresh = "R",      -- Refresh git status
        },
      },
    })
  end,
}
```

The C library will be downloaded automatically on first use. No `build` step needed!

### Managing Library Installation

The plugin automatically manages the C library installation:

**Automatic Updates:**
- The library is automatically downloaded on first use
- When you update the plugin to a new version, the library is automatically updated to match
- No manual intervention required!

**Manual Installation Commands:**
```vim
" Install/update the library manually
:CodeDiff install

" Force reinstall (useful for troubleshooting)
:CodeDiff install!
```

**Version Management:**
The installer reads the `VERSION` file to download the matching library version from GitHub releases. This ensures compatibility between the Lua code and C library.

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esmuellert/vscode-diff.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/vscode-diff.nvim
```

2. Add to your Neovim runtime path in `init.lua`:
```lua
vim.opt.rtp:append("~/.local/share/nvim/vscode-diff.nvim")
```

The C library will be downloaded automatically on first use.

### Building from Source (Optional)

If you prefer to build the C library yourself instead of using pre-built binaries:

**Build requirements:**
- **Option 1 (build.sh/build.cmd)**: C compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC/MinGW) - auto-detected
- **Option 2 (CMake)**: CMake 3.15+ and C compiler

**Option 1: Ready-to-use build scripts (no CMake required)**

Linux/macOS/BSD:
```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/vscode-diff.nvim
./build.sh
```

Windows:
```cmd
cd %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim-data\lazy\vscode-diff.nvim
build.cmd
```

**Option 2: CMake (for advanced users)**

All platforms:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Usage

The `:CodeDiff` command supports multiple modes:

### File Explorer Mode

Open an interactive file explorer showing changed files:

```vim
" Show git status in explorer (default)
:CodeDiff

" Show changes for specific revision in explorer
:CodeDiff HEAD~5

" Compare against a branch
:CodeDiff main

" Compare against a specific commit
:CodeDiff abc123

" Compare two revisions (e.g. HEAD vs main)
:CodeDiff main HEAD
```

### Git Diff Mode

Compare the current buffer with a git revision:

```vim
" Compare with last commit
:CodeDiff file HEAD

" Compare with previous commit
:CodeDiff file HEAD~1

" Compare with specific commit
:CodeDiff file abc123

" Compare with branch
:CodeDiff file main

" Compare with tag
:CodeDiff file v1.0.0

" Compare two revisions for current file
:CodeDiff file main HEAD
```

**Requirements:**
- Current buffer must be saved to a file
- File must be in a git repository
- Git revision must exist

**Behavior:**
- Left buffer: Git version (at specified revision) - readonly
- Right buffer: Current buffer content - readonly
- Opens in a new tab automatically
- Async operation - won't block Neovim

### File Comparison Mode

Compare two arbitrary files side-by-side:

```vim
:CodeDiff file file_a.txt file_b.txt
```

### Lua API

```lua
-- Primary user API - setup configuration
require("vscode-diff").setup({
  highlights = {
    line_insert = "DiffAdd",
    line_delete = "DiffDelete",
    char_brightness = 1.4,
  },
})

-- Advanced usage - direct access to internal modules
local diff = require("vscode-diff.diff")
local render = require("vscode-diff.render")
local git = require("vscode-diff.git")

-- Example 1: Compute diff between two sets of lines
local lines_a = {"line 1", "line 2"}
local lines_b = {"line 1", "modified line 2"}
local lines_diff = diff.compute_diff(lines_a, lines_b)

-- Example 2: Get file content from git (async)
git.get_file_content("HEAD~1", "/path/to/repo", "relative/path.lua", function(err, lines)
  if err then
    vim.notify(err, vim.log.levels.ERROR)
    return
  end
  -- Use lines...
end)

-- Example 3: Get git root for a file (async)
git.get_git_root("/path/to/file.lua", function(err, git_root)
  if not err then
    -- File is in a git repository
  end
end)
```

## Architecture

### Components

- **C Module** (`libvscode-diff/`): Fast diff computation and render plan generation
  - Myers diff algorithm
  - Character-level refinement for highlighting
  - Matches VSCode's `rangeMapping.ts` data structures

- **Lua FFI Layer** (`lua/vscode-diff/diff.lua`): Bridge between C and Lua
  - FFI declarations matching C structs
  - Type conversions between C and Lua

- **Render Module** (`lua/vscode-diff/render/`): Neovim buffer rendering
  - VSCode-style highlight groups
  - Virtual line insertion for alignment
  - Side-by-side window management
  - Git status explorer

### Syntax Highlighting

The plugin handles syntax highlighting differently based on buffer type:

**Working files (editable):**
- Behaves like normal buffers with standard highlighting
- Inlay hints disabled by default (incompatible with diff highlights)
- All LSP features available

**Git history files (read-only):**
- Virtual buffers stored in memory, discarded when tab closes
- TreeSitter highlighting applied automatically (if installed)
- LSP not attached (most features meaningless for historical files)
- Semantic token highlighting fetched via LSP request when available

### Highlight Groups

The plugin defines highlight groups matching VSCode's diff colors:

- `CodeDiffLineInsert` - Light green background for inserted lines
- `CodeDiffLineDelete` - Light red background for deleted lines
- `CodeDiffCharInsert` - Deep/dark green for inserted characters
- `CodeDiffCharDelete` - Deep/dark red for deleted characters
- `CodeDiffFiller` - Gray foreground for filler line slashes (`╱╱╱`)

</details>

**Default behavior:**
- Uses your colorscheme's `DiffAdd` and `DiffDelete` for line-level highlights
- Character-level highlights are auto-adjusted based on `vim.o.background`:
  - **Dark themes** (`background = "dark"`): Brightness multiplied by `1.4` (40% brighter)
  - **Light themes** (`background = "light"`): Brightness multiplied by `0.92` (8% darker)
- This auto-detection works out-of-box for most colorschemes
- You can override with explicit `char_brightness` value if needed

**Customization examples:**

```lua
-- Use hex colors directly
highlights = {
  line_insert = "#1d3042",
  line_delete = "#351d2b",
  char_brightness = 1.5,  -- Override auto-detection with explicit value
}

-- Override character colors explicitly
highlights = {
  line_insert = "DiffAdd",
  line_delete = "DiffDelete",
  char_insert = "#3fb950",
  char_delete = "#ff7b72",
}

-- Mix highlight groups and hex colors
highlights = {
  line_insert = "String",
  char_delete = "#ff0000",
}
```
